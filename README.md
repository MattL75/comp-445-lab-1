# COMP 445 - Lab 1

Goal of the lab is to create an HTTP library using sockets. For this purpose, I have used the 'net' package from Node. Furthermore, we are required to create a CURL-like command-line application.

### Running the Application

1. Run 'tsc' to compile to typescript.
2. Run 'httpc ...'.
